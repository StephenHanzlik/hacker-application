SparkFun Electronics Hacker Application
=======================================

[SparkFun Electronics](http://www.sparkfun.com) is *always* on the lookout for developers skilled in the a modern Unix-based web stack. Development projects vary wildly from pushing the boundaries of user experience for our forward-facing websites to building sophisticated internal web-based applications for running the business.

Interested? Here's how to use this repository to get our attention:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a new branch named after you (e.g. *John-Doe*).
3. On your branch: modify / add to the repository per the instruction in the README files for each of the four top-level directories.
4. Issue a pull request back to the main repository for your branch.

Your pull request is your application.

Your pull request will never be merged (to keep this repository open for everyone who follows you). When you've either been hired or declined your pull request will simply be closed.

Internships
===========

We do offer paid internships to the right applicants. The process to apply is the same as for full time employment - follow the instructions above.

Interns would primarily get their feet wet by assisting with quality assurance and code review as well as being assigned low-level bugs and tweaks to pull their weight right from the start. Ultimately, after cultivating trust by producing quality work, small-scale refactoring of existing submodules and the development of wholly new small-scale submodules would be assigned, providing interns with atomic projects that provide solid experience while directly benefiting SparkFun. Interns will learn modern collaborative web development, version control, and code review with professionals.

Our internship program is flexible. Compensation and hours may vary greatly based on skills, experience, and availability.
