SparkFun's Information Technology department is responsible for the continuous development of all SparkFun web properties. This includes the primary ecommerce website ([sparkfun.com](https://www.sparkfun.com)) and the primary educational resources website ([learn.sparkfun.com](https://learn.sparkfun.com)). Also included is Sparkle, SparkFun's custom-built ERP system which is used to manage all content on the aforementioned web properties as well as order processing, customer management, shipping, inventory controls, manufacturing, etc.
