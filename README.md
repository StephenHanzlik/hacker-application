Welcome to the SparkFun Developer employment application repository.

OFFICIAL JOB DESCRIPTION: WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPER
===================================================

SparkFun Electronics is looking for someone who loves to develop for a modern Unix-based web stack. Development projects vary wildly from pushing the boundaries of user experience for our forward-facing website to building sophisticated internal web-based applications for running the business.

Duties and Responsibilities

* Work with QA and end users to thoroughly test new features
* Manage multiple simultaneous dev projects by using version control and branching
* Manage a personal unix-based development environment consisting of a clone of the production web stack
* Cultivate a niche within the code base geared toward your interests and seek out dev projects within that niche (in other words: while you'll be assigned some projects you are expected to develop a feel for what you like to do and what needs to be done and then find projects within that space)

Desired Skills
--------------
* PHP 5.x
* HTML5 + CSS3 (knowledge of CSS libraries like Bootstrap is a plus)
* Modern JavaScript with an emphasis on open source libraries such as jQuery
* Designing/maintaining relational databases (MySQL 5.x / MariaDB 5.x)
