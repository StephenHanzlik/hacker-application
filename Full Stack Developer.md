# Full Stack Developer (Full Time)

## About the Company

[SparkFun Electronics](https://www.sparkfun.com/) is an online shop for the do-it-yourself electronics enthusiast that operates out of a purpose-built 80,000 sqft office in Boulder, CO. Our customers include inventors, artists, students, hobbyists, and just plain curious individuals looking for some fun tinkering with electronics.

SparkFun is also very committed to bringing electronics education into the mainstream by curating free educational materials and working with schools and institutions around the country to bring electronics into the classroom. Lastly, SparkFun is a staunch advocate of the open source movement, most notably being a leader in Open Source Hardware.

SparkFun is a growing company with $32 million in sales in 2014. Having never taken any venture capital, SparkFun grew to its current state entirely on its own ability to generate revenue. This affords SparkFun a high degree of autonomy and independence which fosters a startup-like environment in a well-established medium-sized company.

## About the Department

## The Daily Workflow

Development at SparkFun reflects the exploratory do-it-yourself culture of the entire company. All developers take part in fixing small bugs and developing larger projects, as well as reviewing one another's code. Continuous improvement of the tool set provided to all users is emphasized as well as continuous improvement to the development process itself. Developers are encouraged to explore parts of the code base and discuss what projects inspire them.

Assuming developers work best when genuinely inspired both developer inspiration and relative priority are used to determine what gets worked on and when. Collaborative development is highly encouraged and all developers have ample opportunities to work together on small, informal dev teams focusing on one project, feature, or subsystem.
